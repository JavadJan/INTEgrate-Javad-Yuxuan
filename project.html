            <h1>Project Description</h1>
            <p>
                
                The project aims to build a stronger integration strategy and ecosystem for migrants and asylum seekers
                (women, men, families, LGBTIQ) in Europe through:
            <ul id="contributors">
                <li>Analysis of the local contexts; development of an innovative Integration Strategy Framework (ISF);
                </li>
                <li>Implementation of 5 pilots in 5 different partnering countries: Italy, Spain, Greece, Cyprus and
                    Ireland to test the framework;</li>
                <li>Development of a methodology to measure the impact of the pilots and creation of exploitable
                    materials;</li>
                <li>Dissemination of results through a newly created web-based platform and social media. </li>
                </ul>
            The pilots will allow to test the novel ISF at urban level through a series of activities in four main
            areas: healthcare, employment, social cohesion, capacity building and training of both migrants and local
            citizens. <br /> Pilot activities include among others: knowledge sharing through a newly designed web-based
            platform in English, ISF manuals and toolkits in 4 languages (Italian, Spanish, Greek and English), capacity
            building to foster third country nationals (TCNs) entrance in the labor market, organization of
            intercultural events to facilitate inclusion, anti-racism and anti-xenophobia campaigns to lower prejudice
            and discrimination in local communities, specific training for local citizens in the private and public
            sector (healthcare, police force) to reduce cultural differences and the gap between migrants and service
            offerings.
            <br /> The establishment of multi-stakeholder partnerships at EU level will enable long-term and large-scale
            change aligned with previous AMIF projects (e.g. INTEGRA). The expected impact is the enhancement of
            migration policies through the creation of an innovative integration strategy applicable at EU level that
            will facilitate a more harmonious inclusion of migrants in society.

            <h2>Project objectives</h2>
            <p>
                INTEgreat will advance the state-of-the-art by filling the existing gap. Through the pilot interventions
                it will test and assess the efficacy of a novel Integration Strategy Framework (ISF) in 4 thematic areas
                all related to the integration of migrants. The cross-pollination among pilots will ensure an
                international learning process based on experience and good practice exchange. The ISF will be adapted
                and re-designed in a participatory approach throughout the project, leveraging the feedback from the
                pilots and exploiting content from each other. Furthermore, coherence with national and local policies
                will be also addressed. The ISF will focus on adult target groups (men, women, families) but it will be
                tested on extra vulnerable target groups as well such as migrant single mothers and LGBTIQ. The adoption
                of the Theory of Change will ensure long-term impact. The ISF will be developed and exploited to
                evaluate activities in terms of content quality, learning outcomes from the trainings, behavioural
                shifts to enhance social cohesion, facilitation in accessing the labor market and healthcare services
                and sustainability potential of the ISF. This will guarantee complete coherence along all different
                activities and contents developed in the project assuring the most effective results. Below the main
                objectives are highlighted.
                Objective 1: Development of novel ISF in 4 thematic areas engaging the wider community Outcomes: Mapping
                and reviewing the state-of-the-art on integration strategies in the 5 consortium countries. Engagement
                of TCNs, stakeholders and pilot leaders in the co-design of the ISF. Objective 2: Test and demonstrate
                the ISF by developing and implementing 5 pilots Outcomes: Pilot content development through a
                participatory approach, create awareness on integration, stakeholder engagement aimed at co-creating the
                pilot content.Objective 3: Measure the impact through appropriate assessment methodology, quality
                assurance methodology and ToC. Outcomes: Evaluation of the pilot contents, the impacts on the target
                groups, the relevance of the activities on integration. Evaluation of behavioral changes and efficacy of
                ISF determined by pilot interventions on target groups and the wider communities. Assessment toolkits.
                Objective 4: Develop a replicable and scalable version of the ISF. Outcomes: Development of an
                exploitation plan. Define a strategy, identify opportunities and facilitate synergies for the
                exploitation of INTEgreat results and outcomes for the benefit of end users and stakeholders. Support
                policy makers by identifying specific needs and how to meet those needs through the ISF. Establish the
                extent to which project materials and digital content can be exploited to strengthen the sense of
                belonging of TCNs

            <h2> Sustainability and Long-Term Impact</h2>
            <p>
                INTEgreat has been designed to ensure long-term sustainability of its actions even beyond the official
                end of the project and the EU co-financing. Once the ISF has been tested, assessed and evaluated, the
                materials produced (manuals, guidelines, toolkits and reports) will allow to continue implementing it in
                the 5 countries of the Consortium and to replicate it in other EU countries with some adjustments as
                required by the local socio-political context. Stakeholders involvement and European citizens
                participation is indeed a key factor for the success and sustainability of the project as they will
                support implementation of the ISF at local level. The Exploitation Plan will encourage the broad
                testing, dissemination and use of the ISF at concrete demonstration sites (NGOs, associations, public
                authorities, companies) and will reach a high number of users through innovative channels (informal
                migration councils, use of social media and digital tools etc.). The replicability will be enriched
                thanks to the good practices identified by the members of the Consortium, particularly in relation to
                the four thematic areas: access to employment, healthcare, capacity building & training, social
                cohesion. The aim of INTEgreat is to see to what extent the ISF participatory solutions make it possible
                to: (1) facilitate and enhance the integration process of migrants and (2) change the view of local
                populations on the migration phenomena, encouraging the acceptance of migrants in society. In addition,
                the project will enable migrants to have access to new job opportunities as a long-term sustainability
                goal. A multi-actor and multi-level engagement approach will be followed in the Exploitation Plan, aimed
                at reaching specific audiences that cover policy, regulatory, scientific, commercial and socio-economic
                aspects. INTEgreat plans to engage a number of policy makers who will support the project and become
                multipliers of good integration practices resulting from the ISF.

            <h2>Information on the project timeline</h2>
            <p>
                The project duration is 3 years. The project started on January 26, 2022. The first eight months of
                INTEgreat are dedicated to literature and policy analysis in the five countries, conducting interviews
                with local stakeholders, addressing challenges in the integration system and finding solutions,
                developing the Integration Strategy Framework, creating the project web-based platform and designing the
                activities to be implemented through the pilots. On the ninth or tenth month of the project the pilots
                will begin in each country and last 18 months. During this time the ISF will be tested and improved as
                we receive feedback from the migrants and the local stakeholders (policy makers, civil society, sector
                organizations etc.). The pilots’ activities will be assessed and their impacts as well as
                cross-pollination activities will be measured through a set of KPIs. A combination of selected methods,
                such as promoting educational materials, dialogues, networking events and project meetings, will be
                utilized depending on the targeted audience and type of dissemination objective. INTEgreat dissemination
                actions aim at communicating the project's objectives, activities and results to a wide audience through
                the use of the web-based platform, the I-Hub, live events, conferences, meetings, radio, TV and the use
                of social media throughout the project.
